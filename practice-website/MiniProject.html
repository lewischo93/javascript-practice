        <h1 class="firstHeaderOne"> The Vancouver Canucks' 2011 Stanley Cup Finals Run</h1>
        </div>
            <p>This is a rudimentary page about the Vancouver Canucks back in 2011. The team was one win away from capturing their first Stanley Cup in franchise history but fell short.</p>
            <P>They fell in seven games to the <span style="color: yellow">Boston Bruins</span>. Ever since then, the utter dislike/hatred for the Bruins remained, almost ten years later.</P>

        <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Intro to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals Run</h2>
        </div>
            <p class=paragraphIndent>The Canucks finished the 2010-2011 regular season with 117 points, first in the entire NHL, resulting in being awarded the President's Trophy. The season also started with Henrik Sedin receiving the captaincy from Roberto Luongo to start off the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Canucks.
            </p>
        
        <div>
            <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px">Round 1: Chicago Blackhawks (<span style="font: bold">VAN</span> wins 4-3)</h3>
        </div>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">The Canucks first faced the <span style="color: red">Chicago Blackhawks</span>, a long-time rival since 2009. The Blackhawks eliminated the Canucks in 2009 and 2010 in the second round so fans were 
                <br />hoping to avoid a threepeat of history. The Blackhawks in 2010 went on to win their first Stanley Cup in almost fifty years in six games against the Philadelphia Flyers.
                <br />Vancouver won the first three games and it looked like they could sweep the defending Cup champions but the Blackhawks, with the return of Dave Bolland, stormed back to win the next three games, forcing a Game 7 back in Vancouver.
                <br />In Game 7, Alex Burrows scored early in the first period with a no-look pass from Ryan Kesler. The game remained 1-0 through out the rest of the first and second periods. During the last minute of the third period, the Blackhawks managed to tie the game with a clutch goal by Jonathan Toews who was on his stomach and just wristed the puck past Luongo. 
                <br />Shit.</p>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">So they went to overtime, the most exciting and dreaded moment in NHL playoff hockey. Every shot matters. Every shift matters. Every pass, success or fail, matters. Then, Alex Burrows, again, at 5:22 of overtime, batted down an errant puck from Chris Campoli and drove to the net. 
                <br />With the puck rolling and unstable, all Burrows could do was just settle it down on the fly and take a shot. Who knows? Maybe it goes in, maybe it doesn't. But the puck does in past Crawford's shoulder. Top cheese. Burrows. SCORES!!!
               <div class=burrowsScores>
                <br />"Kane, Campoli missed the puck. Ryan Johnson gets it out. Hamhuis dumped the puck back in...Campoli trying to clear it. Burrows SHOOTS! 
                <br />SSSCCCCCOOOOORRRRRRRRRREEEESSSS!!!!! 
                <br />Alex Burrows started it. Had so many chances to seal it. And then finally won it in overtime! Finally, after three seasons, and nineteen playoff games against Chicago, for Vancouver, it's a wonderful day for an exorcism!""

        </div>
            <p class="text-align: center; paragraphIndent">The Canucks then went to the second round to face the Nashville Predators. This series was where Ryan Kesler dominated the series, amassing 5 goals and 6 assists in the series. This would eventually haunt the Predators, albeit less so, six years later. Roberto Luongo provided excellent goaltending and the Canucks defense overall was solid, allowing Luongo to rest a bit easier. 
                <br /> Not much else to say for this series. Honestly, it was kind of the most boring series during this run so I'm gonna skip this series. It was just pure Ryan Kesler domination.

        <div>
            <h5 style="text-align:center; font-size: 25px"> Western Conference Finals: San Jose Sharks (VAN wins 4-1)</h5>
        </div>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">During this period, the San Jose Sharks were what the Canucks are in 2020: young, rising team with a solid core to carry the team in the coming years (maybe much less than the 2020 Canucks). The Canucks were in their prime in 2011 and the Sharks put up a valiant effort against the Canucks. Vancouver's offense really shined during this series, particularly in Game 2, defeating the Sharks 7-3 at Rogers Arena.
                <br /> This series is well remembered for Kevin Bieksa's "Stanchion Goal" in Game 5.
                <br /> Vancouver is able to tie the game 2-2 in the dying seconds of the third period thanks to a last minute goal by Ryan Kesler. The game then goes into overtime where both sides refuse to give in. Both sides are tired but do their best to keep playing. One small mistake could lead to a monumental turning point for either team. Great chances for both teams: Niemi (SJS) and Luongo (VAN) were excellent in their respective nets, gobbling up the pucks whenever they could rather than leave it to chance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-align: center, paragraphIndent"> However, in double overtime, at 10:18 on the clock, Alexander Edler on the right side of the SJS zone tosses the puck to the boards on his right. The puck goes in an unknown trajectory but somehow...just somehow...finds its way towards a waiting Kevin Bieksa who saw the puck coming towards him. He is the only one to see the puck and he shoots the puck towards the Sharks net with bodies in front. The puck goes in the next past Niemi who had no idea where the puck was. Everyone assumed it was out of play but they couldn't see the puck in the netting or in the stands.</p>
            <p class="text-align: center, paragraphIndent">Back then, these kinds of goals were unreviewable so the goal stood. And with this goal, the Vancouver Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in seventeen years (last appearance was in 1994. We don't talk about that.) Rejoice, Vancouver, this is as good as it gets. Wait until the Finals happen! Oh boy, that was one helluva depressing series!</p>

            <h6 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px">Stanley Cup Finals: Boston Bruins (BOS wins 4-3) PAIN. SO. MUCH. PAIN!!!!!</h6>
        </div>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">I hate this series. I hate talking about it. Yes I am over it but when you consider the sharp decline the Canucks suffered after this run, this is as happy as I can be, at least until some kids named Elias Pettersson, Bo Horvat, Brock Boeser, Thatcher Demko, and Quinn Hughes arrived half a decade later.</p>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">This series was Boston's to lose. It only took them from Game 3 onwards to wake up and take over from there. Vancouver had no more gas in the tank. They were battered, injured, and exhausted. Not to say the Bruins probably weren't, but the Bruins just had more willpower to win the Canucks did. I'm not going to even go through this series as it happened, but rather, I'll talk about my opinions on why Vancouver lost this series.</p>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">Vancouver lost because they didn't score enough goals. Simple as that. The total goal count was 23-8 for Boston. Boston scored as many goals in Game 3 alone as the Canucks in the ENTIRE SERIES. I'm sorry, but how do you expect to win a series when your opponent nearly tripled your total goal count? You can't. It'd be some miraculous comeback with divine intervention and I don't think God had a role in this sport. It definitely was not Luongo's fault the team lost. Yes, he had some bad games, but the team playing in front of him didn't fare much better.</p>
            <p class="text-align:center; paragraphIndent">Canucks fans got insufferably cocky but I may have gotten cocky at one point but I remembered how comebacks can happen and playoff hockey is extremely unpredictable. So, yes, Boston wins this series and wins the 2011 Stanley Cup after being down two games to start the series. They eventually tied the series 2-2, tied it again 3-3, and won the final decisive game 7. Eight years later, they would suffer the same fate as the Canucks did but I don't think that has anything to do with the Vancouver Canucks.</p>

            <p><b>2018</b>: Misses playoffs. End of the Sedins' careers as they announce their retirement in April. Emotional farewell and I may have gotten teary-eyed during their final home and away games. Drafting seventh overall, they select Quinn Hughes.</p>
            <p><b>2019</b>: Misses playoffs. Debut of Elias Pettersson in October and Quinn Hughes in late March. Drafting 10th overall: Vasiliy Podkolzin. I have no idea who that is.</p>
