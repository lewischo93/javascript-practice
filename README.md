Lewis' practice for improving on javascript

The purpose of this repository is for Lewis to understand the concept of javascript programming. It is more important to understand than get the assignment answers correct.

Once a week, Simon will teach a concept and go over some programming techniques. For the rest of the week, it is expected that Lewis will practice on his own with the given assignemnts.

General steps for pushing to git:
1. `git status` to see what files have been changed locally    
2. `git add [files-to-add-here]` (eg. `git add .` for add all files to be prepped for commit. `git add test.js` for just `test.js` file to be prepped for commit)    
3. `git commit -m "[some-message-here]"` to commit all the files you added via `git add`. It is now ready to be pushed    
4. `git push` to push all the committed files to remote git repository    
** You can always run `git status` to see the status of your file commits
